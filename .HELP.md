## Important Notes
- You can only use port **3000** (for angular frontend) and port **5000** (for springboot server). **DONT USE ANY OTHER PORT**.  
  Instructions to set a different port for angular and springboot are mentioned in the below sections titled "Angular" and "Java (Springboot)" 
- **Port 4200, 8080 are used internally for the ide to run. PLEASE DON'T CLOSE THE APPLICATIONS ALREADY RUNNING IN THESE PORTS OR ELSE THE IDE WILL FAIL TO FUNCTION**
- If while running any commands in the terminal you face "Permission denied" error, you can prefix your command with `sudo` to run the command with elevated privileges


## Environment
- Node v19
- Java v11
- Angular cli v15 (installed globally)
- Maven v3.9.4
- Git v2.25.1
- MySql
- Angular extensions for intellisense
- STS v4 (Spring starter kit) extension
- Thunder Client extension for api testing
- MySQL vs code extension


## Angular
- To start an angular application, go the angular project root and run the following command.  
  `ng serve --port 3000 --disable-host-check`   
  The platform allows port 3000 for frontend applications and we need to turn host check off to run the site over https  
- To see the browser preview you can click on the `Open browser preview` option in the extension named "WeCP Projects".
- When calling backend apis from your angular applications you can't use localhost. You will need to provide the https url on which the backend is running.  
You can get the backend server url by clicking on the `Show backend server url` option in the extension named "WeCP Projects" or you can run the command `echo "$domain_5000"` in terminal to get the backend url


## Java (Springboot)
- Only port 5000 is allowed for backend servers, please set `server.port=5000` in `application.properties` to run the server at 5000.
- use `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the panel to view all available commands for STS (spring starter kit). Ex `Spring initializr: Create a maven Project` command will set up the boiler plate code for a maven app
- To then run the app you can do `Ctrl+Shift+P` followed by the command `Spring Boot Dashboard: Connect`. This will then open the `Spring Boot Dashboard` extension which you can use to run the app.

## MySQL
- The mysql database is by default running in localhost at port 3306. Database credentials are  
  `username=root, password=root`
- You can use the extension named `Database` in the extensions pannel to connect to the mysql database via gui interface or use the command `mysql -u root -p root` to connect from the terminal directly
